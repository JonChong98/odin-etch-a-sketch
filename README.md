# odin-etch-a-sketch
Etch-A-Sketch assignment from The Odin Project  
  
This project recreates the functionality of an etch-a-sketch in a browser by creating a grid where users can colour individual grid spaces using their mouse. The user can colour the spaces black or with a random colour, and change the density of the grid.
